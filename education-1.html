			<h1>What is physical abuse?</h1>
			<p class="pp">Physical abuse is when someone hurts or harms a child or young person on purpose. It includes:
			</p>
			<p> &#9679; Hitting with hands or objects</p>
			<p> &#9679; Slapping and punching</p>
			<p> &#9679; Kicking</p>
			<p> &#9679; Shaking</p>
			<p> &#9679; Throwing</p>
			<p> &#9679; Poisoning</p>
			<p> &#9679; Burning and scalding</p>
			<p> &#9679; Biting and scratching</p>
			<p> &#9679; Breaking bones</p>
			<p> &#9679; Drowning</p>
			<p class="pp">It's important to remember that physical abuse is any way of intentionally causing physical
				harm to a child or young person. It also includes making up the symptoms of an illness or causing a
				child to become unwell.</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>Signs of physical abuse</h1>
			<p class="pp">Bumps and bruises don't always mean a child is being physically abused. All children have
				accidents, trips and falls. And there isn't just one sign or symptom to look out for. But it's important
				to be aware of the signs.</p>
			<p class="pp">If a child regularly has injuries, there seems to be a pattern to the injuries or the
				explanation doesn't match the injuries, then this should be reported.</p>
			<p class="pp">Physical abuse symptoms include:</p>
			<p> &#9679; Bruises</p>
			<p> &#9679; Broken or fractured bones</p>
			<p> &#9679; Burns of scalds</p>
			<p> &#9679; Bite marks.</p>
			<p class="pp">It can also include other injuries and health problems, such as:</p>
			<p> &#9679; Scarring</p>
			<p> &#9679; The effects of poisoning, such as vomiting, drownsiness or seizures</p>
			<p> &#9679; Breathing problems from drowning, suffocation or poisoning.</p>
			<p class="pp">Head injuries in babies and toddlers can be signs of abuse so it's important to be aware of
				these. Visible signs include:</p>
			<p> &#9679; Swelling</p>
			<p> &#9679; Bruising</p>
			<p> &#9679; Fractures</p>
			<p> &#9679; Being extremely sleepy or unconscious</p>
			<p> &#9679; Breathing problems</p>
			<p> &#9679; Seizures</p>
			<p> &#9679; Vomiting</p>
			<p> &#9679; Unusual behavior, such as being irritable or not feeling properly</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>If a child reveals abuse</h1>
			<p class="pp">A child who is being physically abused might not realise what’s happening is wrong. And they
				might even blame themselves. If a child talks to you about physical abuse it’s important to:</p>
			<p> &#9679; Listen carefully to what they're saying</p>
			<p> &#9679; Let them know they've done the right thing by telling you</p>
			<p> &#9679; Tell them it's not their fault</p>
			<p> &#9679; Say you'll take them seriously</p>
			<p> &#9679; Don't confront the alleged abuser</p>
			<p> &#9679; Explain what you'll do next</p>
			<p> &#9679; Report what the child has told you as soon as possible.</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>Effects of physical abuse</h1>
			<p class="pp">Physical abuse can have long lasting effects on children and young people. It can lead to poor
				physical or mental health later in life, including:</p>
			<p> &#9679; Anxiety</p>
			<p> &#9679; Behaviour issues</p>
			<p> &#9679; Criminal behaviour</p>
			<p> &#9679; Depression</p>
			<p> &#9679; Drug and alcohol problems</p>
			<p> &#9679; Eating disorders</p>
			<p> &#9679; Issues at school</p>
			<p> &#9679; Obesity</p>
			<p> &#9679; Risky sexual behaviour</p>
			<p> &#9679; Suicidal thoughts and/or attempts.</p>
			<h3>Effects of shaking a baby or infant</h3>
			<p class="pp">If a baby or infant is shaken or thrown, they might suffer head or brain injuries, causing:
			</p>
			<p> &#9679; Fractures</p>
			<p> &#9679; Internal injuries</p>
			<p> &#9679; Long-term disabilities</p>
			<p> &#9679; Learning problems</p>
			<p> &#9679; Seizures</p>
			<p> &#9679; Hearing and speech problems</p>
			<p> &#9679; Sight issues or blindness</p>
			<p> &#9679; Behaviour issues</p>
			<p> &#9679; Brain damage</p>
			<p> &#9679; Death.</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>Who's at risk</h1>
			<p class="pp">Physical abuse can happen in any family. But some parents might find it hard to give their
				children a safe and loving home if they're facing:</p>
			<p> &#9679; Poverty</p>
			<p> &#9679; Poor housing</p>
			<p> &#9679; Issues with drugs and alcohol</p>
			<p> &#9679; Mental health issues</p>
			<p> &#9679; Relationship problems</p>
			<p> &#9679; Domestic abuse</p>
			<p> &#9679; Isolation or a lack of support</p>
			<p> &#9679; The effects of childhood abuse or neglect.</p>
			<p class="pp">Babies have a higher risk of suffering physical abuse as well as disabled children, especially
				those who are unable to tell someone what's happening or don't understand what's happening to them is
				abuse.</p>
