            <h1>What is sexual abuse?</h1>
            <p class="pp">When a child or young person is sexually abused, they're forced or tricked into sexual activities. They might not understand that what's happening is abuse or that it's wrong. And they might be afraid to tell someone. Sexual abuse can happen anywhere – and it can happen in person or online.</p>
            <p class="pp">It's never a child's fault they were sexually abused – it's important to make sure children know this.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Types of sexual abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">There are 2 types of sexual abuse – contact and non-contact abuse. And sexual abuse can happen in person or online.</p>
            <p class="pp">Contact abuse is where an abuser makes physical contact with a child. This includes:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Sexual touching of any part of a child's body, whether they're clothed or not</p>
            <p> &#9679; Using a body part or object to rape or penetrate a child</p>
            <p> &#9679; Forcing a child to take part in sexual activities</p>
            <p> &#9679; Making a child undress or touch someone else.</p>
            <p class="pp">Contact abuse can include touching, kissing and oral sex – sexual abuse isn't just penetrative.</p>
            <p class="pp">Non-contact abuse is where a child is abused without being touched by the abuser. This can be in person or online and includes:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Exposing or flashing</p>
            <p> &#9679; Showing pornography</p>            
            <p> &#9679; Exposing a child to sexual acts</p>
            <p> &#9679; Making them masturbate</p>
            <p> &#9679; Forcing a child to make, view or share child abuse images or videos</p>
            <p> &#9679; Making, viewing or distributing child abuse images or videos</p>
            <p> &#9679; Forcing a child to take part in sexual activities or conversations online or through a smartphone.</p>

            <h1>Signs of sexual abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">Knowing the signs of sexual abuse can help give a voice to children. Sometimes children won't understand that what's happening to them is wrong. Or they might be scared to speak out. Some of the signs you might notice include:</p>

            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Alcohol or drug misuse.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>If a child reveals abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">If a child talks to you about sexual abuse it's important to:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Listen carefully to what they're saying</p>
            <p> &#9679; Let them know they've done the right thing by telling you</p>
            <p> &#9679; Tell them it's not their fault</p>
            <p> &#9679; Say you'll take them seriously</p>
            <p> &#9679; Don't confront the alleged abuser</p>
            <p> &#9679; Explain what you'll do next</p>
            <p> &#9679; Report what the child has told you as soon as possible.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Effects of sexual abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">Sexual abuse can have both short and long term effects. The impact of sexual abuse can last a lifetime. Children, young people and adults may live with:</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>Who's at risk</h1>
            <p class="pp">Any child is at risk of being sexual abused. It's important to remember that both boys and girls can be sexually abused.</p>
            <p class="pp">Most children who've been sexual abused were abused by someone they know. This could be a family member, a friend or someone who has targeted them – like a teacher or sports coach.</p>
            <p class="pp">Children who are sexually abused online could be abused by someone they know. They could also be abused by someone who commits a one-off sexually abusive act or a stranger who builds a relationship with them.</p>
            <p class="pp">Some children are more at risk of sexual abuse. Children with disabilities are more likely to be sexually abused – especially those who are unable to tell someone what's happening or don't understand what's happening to them is abuse.</p>
            <p class="pp">Some abusers target children who are isolated or being neglected by their parents or carers. If a family is going through a tough time, they might not be able to give their child enough attention or supervision, putting them in unsafe situations.</p>
