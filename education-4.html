            <h1>What is neglect?</h1>
            <p class="pp">Neglect is the ongoing failure to meet a child's basic needs and the most common form of child abuse. A child might be left hungry or dirty, or without proper clothing, shelter, supervision or health care. This can put children and young people in danger. And it can also have long term effects on their physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Types of neglect</h1>
            <p class="pp">Neglect can be a lot of different things, which can make it hard to spot. But broadly speaking, there are 4 types of neglect.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Physical neglect: &#160; A child's basic needs, such as food, clothing or shelter, are not met or they aren'y properly supervised or kept safe.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Educational neglect: &#160; A parent doesn't ensure their child is given an education.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Emotional neglect: &#160; A child doesn't get the nurture and stimulation they need. This could be through ignoring, humiliating, intimidating or isolating them.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Medical neglect: &#160; A child isn't given proper health care. This includes dental care and refusing or ignoring medical recommendations.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Signs of neglect</h1>
            <p class="pp">Neglect can be really difficult to spot. Having one of the signs doesn't necessarily mean a child is being neglected.

            <h1>If a child reveals abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">A child who is being neglected might not realise what’s happening is wrong. And they might even blame themselves. If a child talks to you about neglect it’s important to:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Listen carefully to what they're saying</p>
            <p> &#9679; Let them know they've done the right thing by telling you</p>
            <p> &#9679; Tell them it's not their fault</p>
            <p> &#9679; Say you'll take them seriously</p>
            <p> &#9679; Don't confront the alleged abuser</p>
            <p> &#9679; Explain what you'll do next</p>
            <p> &#9679; Report what the child has told you as soon as possible.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Effects of neglect</h1>
            <p class="pp">Neglect changes childhood. Children who've been neglected might experience short-term and long-term effects. These can include:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Problems with brain development</p>
            <p> &#9679; Taking risks, like running away from home, using drugs and alcohol or breaking the law</p>
            <p> &#9679; Getting into dangerous relationships</p>
            <p> &#9679; Difficulty with relationships later in life, including with their own children</p>
            <p> &#9679; A higher chance of having mental health problems, including depression.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Who's at risk</h1>
            <p class="pp">Any child can suffer neglect. But some children and young people are more at risk than others. These include children who:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Are born prematurely</p>
            <p> &#9679; Have a disability</p>
            <p> &#9679; Have complex health needs</p>
            <p> &#9679; Are in care</p>
            <p> &#9679; Are seeking asylum.</p>
            <p class="pp">Other problems and life circumstances can make it harder for parents and carers to meet their child's needs. When one or more of these issues occur, it can put a child at risk of neglect.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Domestic abuse: &#160; Children living in home where there's domestic abuse are more likely to experience other types of abuse and neglect.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Drugs or alcohol: &#160; Children living with parents with alcohol or drug problems can be more at risk of harm and neglect. These issues can make it difficult for parents and carers to look after their children.</p>
            <p> &#9679; History of abuse: &#160; Being abused or neglected as child doesn't mean someone will go on to harm others. But a lot of people who abuse or neglect children have experienced it themselves. We've got support for adults who faced abuse as children.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Learning disabilities: &#160; Just because a parent has learning disabilities or difficulties it doesn't mean they aren't a great mum or dad. But some parents can struggle to understand what they need to do to provide proper care for their child. In some cases, this can lead to a child being neglected.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Mental health: &#160; Most parents or carers with a mental health problem give their children the love, care and support they need. But some might struggle at certain times. This can mean children might be at a higher risk of abuse or neglect.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Living in poverty: &#160; Housing and money worries can put a lot of stress on parents. This can stop them being able to provide the practical and emotional support that children need, which can lead to neglect.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Lack of support: &#160; Family, friends, neighbours or the wider community can give parents the support they need to help keep their child safe. But sometimes parents don't have this support which can put children at a higher risk of neglect.</p>
