            <h1>What is emotional abuse?</h1>
            <p class="pp">Emotional abuse is any type of abuse that involves the continual emotional mistreatment of a child. It's sometimes called psychological abuse. Emotional abuse can involve deliberately trying to scare, humiliate, isolate or ignore a child.</p>
            <p class="pp">Emotional abuse is often a part of other kinds of abuse, which means it can be difficult to spot the signs or tell the difference, though it can also happen on its own.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Types of emotional abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">Emotional abuse includes:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Humiliating or constantly criticising a child</p>
            <p> &#9679; Threatening, shouting at a child or calling them names</p>
            <p> &#9679; Making the child the subject of jokes, or using sarcasm to hurt a child</p>
            <p> &#9679; Blaming and scapegoating</p>
            <p> &#9679; Making a child perform degrading acts</p>
            <p> &#9679; Not recognising a child's own individuality or trying to control their lives</p>
            <p> &#9679; Pushing a child too hard or not recognising their limitations</p>
            <p> &#9679; Exposing a child to upsetting events or situations, like domestic abuse or drug taking</p>
            <p> &#9679; Failing to promote a child's social development</p>
            <p> &#9679; Not allowing them to have friends</p>
            <p> &#9679; Persistently ignoring them</p>
            <p> &#9679; Being absent</p>
            <p> &#9679; Manipulating a child</p>
            <p> &#9679; Never saying anything kind, expressing positive feelings or congratulating a child on successes</p>
            <p> &#9679; Never showing any emotions in interactions with a child, also known as emotional neglect.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Signs of emotional abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">There might not be any obvious physical signs of emotional abuse or neglect. And a child might not tell anyone what's happening until they reach a 'crisis point'. That's why it's important to look out for signs in how a child is acting.</p>
            <p class="pp">As children grow up, their emotions change. This means it can be difficult to tell if they're being emotionally abused. But children who are being emotionally abused might:</p>
            <p> &#9679; seem unconfident or lack self-assurance</p>
            <p> &#9679; struggle to control their emotions</p>
            <p> &#9679; have difficulty making or maintaining relationships</p>
            <p> &#9679; act in a way that's inappropriate for their age.</p>
            <p class="pp">The signs of emotional abuse can also be different for children at different ages.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Signs in babies and toddlers</p>
            <p>Babies and pre-school children who are being emotionally abused or neglected might:</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Be overly-affectionate to strangers or people they don't know well</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Seem unconfident, wary or anxious</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Not have a close relationship or bond with their parent</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Be aggressive or cruel towards other children or animals.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Signs in older children</p>
            <p>Older children might:</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Use language you wouldn't expect them to know for their age</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Act in a way or know about things you wouldn't expect them to know for their age</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Struggle to control their emotions</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Have extreme outbursts</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Seem isolated from their parents</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Lack social skills</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Have few or no friends.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>If a child reveals abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">A child who is being emotionally abused might not realise what's happening is wrong. And they might even blame themselves. If a child talks to you about emotional abuse it's important to:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Listen carefully to what they're saying</p>
            <p> &#9679; Let them know they've done the right thing by telling you</p>
            <p> &#9679; Tell them it's not their fault</p>
            <p> &#9679; Say you'll take them seriously</p>
            <p> &#9679; Don't confront the alleged abuser</p>
            <p> &#9679; Explain what you'll do next</p>
            <p> &#9679; Report what the child has told you as soon as possible.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Effects of emotional abuse</h1>
            <p class="pp">Over time, emotional abuse and neglect can have serious long term effects on a child's social, emotional and physical health and development. This includes:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Behaviour problems</p>
            <p>Emotional abuse can change how a child behaves, such as:</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Wanting attention or becoming clingy</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Not caring how they act or what happens to them</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Trying to make people dislike them</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Developing risky behaviour, like stealing, bullying or running away.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Emotional development</p>
            <p>Emotional abuse can affect a child's emotional development, including:</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Feeling, expressing and controlling emotions</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Lacking confidence or causing anger problems</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Finding it difficult to make and maintain healthy relationships later in life</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Higher levels of depression and health problems as adults compared to those who experienced other types of child abuse.</p>
            <p> &#9679; Mental health problems</p>
            <p>Emotional abuse of child or young person can increase the risk of:</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Mental health problems, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Eating disorders</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Self-harm</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Language development</p>
            <p class="p-p"> &#9658; Problems forming healthy relationships.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Who's at risk</h1>
            <p class="pp">Any child, from any background, can be at risk of emotional abuse. But some are more vulnerable than others.</p>
            <p class="pp">Children who are emotionally abused are often suffering another type of abuse or neglect at the same time â€“ but this isn't always the case.</p>
            <p class="pp">When a family is going through a tough time, parents and carers might find it difficult to provide a safe and loving home for their children. This can happen when families are experiencing:</p>
            <p> &#9679; Relationship problems</p>
            <p> &#9679; Family arguments</p>
            <p> &#9679; Money problems or unemployment</p>
            <p> &#9679; Mental health issues</p>
            <p> &#9679; Poverty</p>
            <p> &#9679; Addiction to drugs or alcohol</p>
            <p> &#9679; Domestic abuse.</p>
